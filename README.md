Repo for the DECIDE task in DD2480. This project works as part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system, which would provide a function to decide whether the missile should be launched.

## Requirements

The requirements can be downloaded [here](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/45179/files/7221049/download?wrap=1). According to that, this repo is composed by the following part:

- **IO Operation** : Read inputs fron JSON file and output the decision.
- **LIC functions** : 15 different functions that decide whether a condition is met.
- **Final Decision** : Calculate PUM & FUV and decide whether to launch according to the results.
- **Tests** : Unit tests and integration tests to ensure code is functioning well.

The program would take the following as input.

- **NUMPOINTS** : The number of planar data points.
- **POINTS** : Array containing the coordinates of data points. 
- **PARAMETERS** : Struct holding parameters for LICs. 
- **LCM** : Logical Connector Matrix.
- **PUV** : Preliminary Unlocking Vector.

And calculate the following values for decision.
- **CMV** : Conditions Met Vector.
- **PUM** : Preliminary Unlocking Matrix.
- **FUV** : Final Unlocking Vector.

Then a final decision is made based on FUV.

## Usage

We use [maven](https://maven.apache.org) as the package manager for our project, which can be installed with the following commands.
```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install maven
```
Then the following commands can be run:
```sh
$ mvn package # Build the project and run unit tests
$ mvn test # Only run the tests without rebuild
$ mvn exec:java # Run the main function
$ mvn javadoc:javadoc # Generate documentation
```

## Coding Standard

We follow [Sun's Java Style](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/sun_style.html) and enforce the standard via [CheckStyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/index.html).

## API Documentation

API Documentation is automated generated by [JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html) and is deployed on [Github Pages](https://tohanss.github.io/DECIDE/).

## Way of Working

#### Principles Established

- [x] A recommendation for the approach to be taken is available.
- [x] The context within which the team will operate is understood.
- [x] The constraints that apply to the selection, acquisition, and use of practices and tools are known.

#### Foundation Established

- [x] The key practices and tools that form the foundation of the way-of-working are selected.
- [x] Enough practices for work to start are agreed to by the team.
- [x] All non-negotiable practices and tools have been identified.
- [x] The gaps that exist between the practices and tools that are needed and the practices and tools that are available have been analyzed and understood.
- [x] The capability gaps that exist between what is needed to execute the desired way of working and the capability levels of the team have been analyzed and understood.
- [x] The selected practices and tools have been integrated to form a usable way-of-working.

#### In Use

- [x] The practices and tools are being used to do real work.
- [x] The use of the practices and tools selected are regularly inspected.
- [x] The practices and tools are being adapted to the team’s context.
- [x] The use of the practices and tools is supported by the team.
- [x] Procedures are in place to handle feedback on the team’s way of working.
- [x] The practices and tools support team communication and collaboration.

#### In Place

- [x] All team members have access to the practices and tools required to do their work.
- [x] The whole team is involved in the inspection and adaptation of the way-of-working.

#### Working well

- [x] Team members are making progress as planned by using and adapting the way-of-
- [x] working to suit their current context.
- [x] The team naturally applies the practices without thinking about them.
- [x] The tools naturally support the way that the team works.
- [x] The team continually tunes their use of the practices and tools.

#### Retired

- [ ] The team's way of working is no longer being used.
- [x] Lessons learned are shared for future use.
