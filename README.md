Repo for the DECIDE task in DD2480. This project works as part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system, which would provide a function to decide whether the missile should be launched.

## Requirements & Components

The requirements can be downloaded [here](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/45179/files/7221049/download?wrap=1). According to that, this repo is composed by the following part:

- **IO Operation** : Read inputs fron JSON file and output the decision.
- **LIC functions** : 15 different functions that decide whether a condition is met.
- **Final Decision** : Calculate PUM & FUV and decide whether to launch according to the results.
- **Tests** : Unit tests and integration tests to ensure code is functioning well.

## Coding Standard

We follow [Sun's Java Style](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/sun_style.html) and enforce the standard via [CheckStyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/index.html).

## API Documentation

API Documentation is automated generated by [JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html) and is deployed on [Github Pages](https://tohanss.github.io/DECIDE/).
